<h2>Fisher Funk</h2>
<p>
    The Fisher Funk is a time for all Fishermen to travel back in time to the 70's and embrace their inner hippie. Everyone dresses up in miscellaneous apparel (usually from a thrift store), and we all take our lovely dates to go bowling. In the true spirit of the 70's, many people grow out mustaches or bad sideburns, all for the sake of the story.

    While it is not a normal SYR (Screw Your Roommate, consult the "Domer Dictionary" for a full list of phrases commonly used at ND), it is always more fun and casual, and promotes the unparalleled Fisher community.
