<h2>Fred Talks</h2>
<p>
    In Fisher Hall, we are blessed and excited to play as hosts to a series of "Fred Talks." This program of short but powerful speeches allows the men of Fisher Hall to gain insight from some of Notre Dame's most prominent faculty, administrators, coaches and alumni. Fred Talks are a staple of Fisher Hall culture, not only allowing our residents to connect with a unique and accomplished group of individuals, but also helping them to learn how to learn to be more impactful members of the Notre Dame Community.
